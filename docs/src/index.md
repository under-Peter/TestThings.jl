# TestThings.jl

This package is purely for testing purposes, i.e. figuring out how Continuous Integration (with `Travis` and `Appveyor`),
documentation (with `Documenter.jl`) and Coverage work.


The index contains all the functions in autodocs (_maybe_)
```@index
```

Autodocs contain all the doc-strings, nice!

```@autodocs
Modules = [TestThings]
```
